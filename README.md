# PwC - Customer Churn-Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecommunications company and providing actionable strategies to reduce churn rates. The analysis was conducted during a virtual internship with PwC, where I utilized data visualization, segmentation, and predictive analysis techniques to assess current churn rates and predict future customer behavior. The goal is to derive insights from the data and propose strategic actions that can drive customer retention and reduce the churn rate.

The project includes two main dashboards:
1. **Current Churn Analysis Dashboard**: Provides an overview of churn rates, customer demographics, service preferences, and payment behavior.
2. **Predictive Churn Analysis Dashboard**: Offers insights into future churn risks, including customer segmentation by likelihood to churn, and estimates potential revenue loss.

The insights from these dashboards lead to strategic recommendations aimed at reducing churn and improving customer retention.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components:
- **Data Analysis**: Cleaned, transformed, and visualized data to analyze customer churn.
- **Dashboards**: Two main dashboards built using Power BI that present the findings of the churn analysis.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Based on data insights, a set of recommendations for reducing churn was developed.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Techniques such as customer segmentation and predictive analysis were used to forecast future churn behavior.

## Key Insights

### Current Churn Analysis
- **Churn Rate**: 26.54% of customers are leaving, indicating a need for enhanced retention strategies.
- **Customer Demographics**: An even split between male and female customers, with 25% of the customer base being senior citizens, suggesting a tailored retention approach.
- **Subscription Duration**: A significant portion of customers (over 50%) have been with the company for less than a year, highlighting the importance of early engagement to improve retention.
- **Contract Type**: The majority (88.55%) of customers are on month-to-month contracts, which have higher churn rates. Longer-term contracts should be incentivized.

### Service and Payment Insights
- **Internet Service Type**: Customers using Fiber optic services have a notably high churn rate (42%), indicating a potential service satisfaction issue.
- **Payment Methods**: Customers using electronic checks are more likely to churn. Offering more convenient payment options may reduce churn.
- **Additional Services**: Services like tech support and online security have low adoption rates. Promoting these services could enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn.

### Predictive Churn Analysis
- **Risk Segmentation**: Customers on month-to-month contracts using Fiber optic services are identified as high-risk, allowing for more targeted retention efforts.
- **Churn by Duration and Payment Method**: First-year customers, especially those using electronic checks, are at the highest risk of churning. Tailored retention initiatives can significantly reduce this risk.
- **Potential Revenue Impact**: The analysis estimates the potential revenue loss if high-risk customers churn, underlining the importance of focusing on retention efforts for this group.

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the findings from the dashboards, the following strategies are recommended:
1. **Enhanced Customer Engagement**: Target high-risk customers, particularly those on month-to-month contracts and using Fiber optic services, with personalized offers and improved service options.
2. **Incentivize Long-Term Contracts**: Encourage customers to switch from month-to-month to longer-term contracts, possibly by offering discounts or additional benefits, to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn.
3. **Payment Method Optimization**: Offer incentives for customers to switch from electronic checks to more convenient payment methods, such as credit cards or bank transfers, to help reduce churn.
4. **Promotion of Additional Services**: Increase the visibility and adoption of underutilized services such as tech support and online security. This can add value to customer relationships and help reduce churn.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and analysis.
- **Excel/CSV**: Data cleaning and manipulation were performed using Excel and CSV files.
- **SQL**: Data queries for extracting insights and transforming raw data for analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how customer churn analysis, when combined with predictive analytics and strategic recommendations, can drive impactful business decisions. By focusing on high-risk customers and addressing pain points such as payment methods and service offerings, businesses can improve customer retention and reduce churn rates, ultimately ensuring long-term growth.
